**Story**
Once upon a time, there lived a monkey on a jamoon(berry) tree, which was on the banks of a river.
In that river, there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey
offered him some berries. The crocodile came back the next day for more berries, as he loved them.
As days passed by, they became very good friends.
